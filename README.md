Hi, this is the README.md document of 
[ejpg-sys.github.io](https://github.com/ejpg-sys) repository.

This webpage was build with **Bootstrap v5.3 and AngularJS v1.8**.
*For minify process was applied GruntJS (is need to use NodeJS
environment to do it).*

The main goal of this webpage is show the main services executed by
the developer, with a more human approach in user experience, and much
less technical knowledge for interaction (like here direct in GitHub 
repository sources).
